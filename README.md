# Hello-Gitaverse-
Trying out Github for the first time, not even sure what I'm doing

I'm a designer, I'm usually not sure whether to call myself a UIUX designer UX designer or product designer, so most times I just stick with the title designer.
I love people, understanding them, seeing through them and relating with them.
